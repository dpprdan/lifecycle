lifecycle provides a set of tools and conventions to manage the life cycle of your exported functions.

-   For a general motivation and introduction to the key concepts, watch Hadley's rstudio::global(2021) keynote ["Maintaining the house that the tidyverse built"](https://posit.co/resources/videos/maintaining-the-house-the-tidyverse-built/).

-   Read `vignette("stages")` to learn what it means for a function to be experimental, stable, deprecated, or superseded.

-   Read `vignette("manage")` to learn how to manage lifecycle changes in functions that you use.

-   Read `vignette("communicate")` to learn how to communicate lifecycle changes in the functions you write.
